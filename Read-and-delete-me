Edit the DESCRIPTION file to reflect the contents of your package.
Optionally put your raw data under 'inst/extdata/'.
If the datasets are large, they may reside elsewhere outside the package.
Copy .R files that do preprocessing of your data to 'data-raw'
Edit 'data-raw/datasets.R' to source your R files.
Document your data sets using roxygen markup (see comments in datasets.R)

NOTES
If your code relies on other packages, add those to the @import tag of the roxygen markup.
The R object names you wish to make available (and document) in the package must match
the roxygen @name tags and must be called out by keepDataObjects() in datasets.R
(listing them in objectsToKeep in datasets.R is sufficient).
